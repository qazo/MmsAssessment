Answers to the MMS Technical Assessment

This repository hosts a solution with two main projects. One for the Todo API
`MmsTodo.WebApi` and `MmsTodo.Core` (core lib) and web frontend. The frontend is
half-done due to time constraints. The other project is for answering the answer
to question 4.2 (majority element) wich can be run through the `MmsAlgo.Console`
application.

* Algorithm solution in is `./src/MmsAlgo.(Core|Console)`
* Todo API is in `./src/MmsTodo.WebApi`
* Todo frontend source is in `./src/MmsTodo.WebApi/vue-webapp`

There are also tests writtent for both answers. Thse can be found under the
`tests/` directory.

== Running

=== MmsAlgo

Can be run throught he console. Didn't add ability to ready from external
sources like files.

=== MmsTodo

Can run the MmsTodo.WebApi project. I;ve edited the `launchSettings.json` to
default to the wwwroot instead of swagger, so just running the project should be
fine.


NOTE: both projects require .NET 8
